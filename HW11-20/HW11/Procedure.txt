Knight's Tour
Before: Generate an integer array of size 8x8
1. Try to move the knight to the next valid spot (First move allows for any spot
on the board)
2. If there are no valid moves, return the knight to its previous position, and
set the spot the knight was on back to zero
3. If it succeeds, set the zero the knight is on to the move number
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until a solution is found or all spots on the board are used
up for the first move
